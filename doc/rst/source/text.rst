Visualization Description:
Imagine a central node labeled "Expats" with branches extending to all the primary stakeholders, forming the first circle around the central node. Further branches extend from these primary stakeholders to secondary stakeholders, creating a larger circle. For rare and extreme situations, additional branches connect these stakeholders to specialized support entities, forming a third outer circle.

To visualize this map, you could use a diagramming tool like Lucidchart, Microsoft Visio, or even a simple drawing app to create a multi-layered network of circles and nodes, clearly labeling each stakeholder group and their connections to the expats.
